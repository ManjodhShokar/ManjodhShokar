      <h3>Manjodh Shokar</h3>
      <p> Hello, I am Manjodh and before starting my course at city university I had very little coding experience. My only coding experience is from 
      doing a little bit of python during my computer science GCSEs.

    <h3>MY GAME</h3>
    <p>
        My game, concluding the 2nd semester Programming in Java Module at City(20220. This 
        project demonstrates my understanding of java, with things like arrays, inheritance,
        encapsulation, working with files, GUI etc. I created a game where the player character
        has to find 3 different keys around the map which will be used to open the lock at the 
        end of the map. Opening the lock reveals a star which the player can walk into, which 
        will take the player to the next level. Each level has unique challenges, from different
        enemy types, different environments and a bit of parkour. The player character has access
        to 2 different items, a pistol and a key, the pistol can be used to destroy enemies and 
        the key is used to open the locks. Each level is vastly different from each other, they 
        have different backgrounds, music, enemies, platforms and items.There are lives presented 
        on the foreground which increases if you heal, or decrease if you take damage. The GUI 
        allows the player to pause the game, go to the next level, adjust the volume of the game
        and to make save files. The most challenging part of developing the game for me, was just
        having everything interact in a way I want them to, since I am new to coding, getting everything
        to do what I wanted it to do and interact in a way I wanted it to do was difficult but I got it
        down in the end.
